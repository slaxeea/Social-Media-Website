Hi, this is the repository for a project I made in school

It's not nearly finished but I am still working on it.

Everything is based on a tutorialseries from classed on YouTube.

This repository only covers the front-end, backend software is in another repository

By the way, this is the first Project i used GitHub for so if I made any mistakes, please tell me!
